# Stock-Market-Analysis

Overview
This GitHub repository hosts a stock price prediction project that focuses on predicting stock prices for HDFC Bank using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. While the project currently focuses on stock price prediction, it also has plans to incorporate portfolio management for maximizing returns, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 market crash.

Description
Stock price prediction is a fundamental field in finance and machine learning. This project provides a comprehensive guide on predicting stock prices using historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, LSTM neural network modeling, model training, and prediction. The code is implemented in Python and utilizes popular libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and yfinance.

Features
Stock price prediction for HDFC Bank using LSTM neural networks.
Data visualization of historical stock prices.
Model training and evaluation.
Planned integration of real-time prediction and portfolio management.
Data from the last ten years for comprehensive analysis.

Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following:
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, yfinance
Jupyter Notebook or an integrated development environment (IDE)

Data Source
The project uses Yahoo Finance as the data source for HDFC Bank stock prices. Historical data is available from January 1, 2013, to October 1, 2023.

Model Details
The core of this project is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model architecture includes two LSTM layers, two dense layers, and utilizes the Adam optimizer.

Results
The project includes an evaluation of the model's performance, including the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). You can visualize the predictions compared to actual stock prices to assess the model's accuracy.
